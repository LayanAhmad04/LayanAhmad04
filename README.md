## 💡 About Me

Hi! I’m Layan, a curious and creative developer who just graduated with a degree in Computer Science. I thrive at the intersection of logic and design—whether it's building clean, intuitive UIs or exploring how AI can make tech smarter and more human.

I’ve worked on a range of exciting projects, from an AI-powered social media extension (ClarifAI) to a Kotlin-based E-Commerce app. I’m currently expanding my full-stack skills and building a dynamic portfolio in **React** and **Next.js**.
